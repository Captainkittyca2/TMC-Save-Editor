# WIP TMC Save Editor

This is a work-in-progress save editor for The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap. The plan is to eventually allow the user to modify everything or nearly everything related to the save file checks, including items unlocked, file names, currently equipped items, current map located in, amount of health left, heart pieces collected, and more.

## Currently supported features:

* modifying file names
* modifying message speed
* modifying brightness level
* modifying amount of hearts
* modifying health remaining
* modifying rupees remaining
* modifying current area and room
* modifying spawn animation
* modifying spawn points
* hatless or not (will cause issues)
* Triforce or not (file select)
