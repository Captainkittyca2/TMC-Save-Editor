# WIP TMC Save Editor

This is a work-in-progress save editor for The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap. The plan is to eventually allow the user to modify everything or nearly everything related to the save file checks, including items unlocked, file names, currently equipped items, current map located in, amount of health left, heart pieces collected, and more.

## Currently supported features:

* File names
* Message speed
* Brightness level
* Amount of hearts
* Health remaining
* Rupees remaining
* Bomb and Arrow ammo
* Quiver and Bomb bag level
* Current area and room
* Spawn animation
* Spawn points
* hatless or not (will cause issues)
* Triforce or not (file select)
* Items on A and B buttons
* Item checks
* Item upgrades
