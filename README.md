# WIP TMC Save Editor

This is a work in progress save editor for The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap. The plan is to eventually allow the user to modify everything or nearly everything related to the save file checks, including: items unlocked, file names, currently equiped items, current map located in, amount of health left, heart pieces collected, and more.

## Currently supported features:

* modifying file names (for file 1)
* modifying message speed
* modifying brightness level
* modifying health remaining
* modifying rupees remaining
* modifying current area and room
* modifying spawn animation
* modifying spawn points
* hatless or not (will cause issues)
